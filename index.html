      <td>Sabyasachi's design philosophy is "personalized imperfection of the human hand".
        Deserts, gypsies, prostitutes, antique textiles and cultural traditions of his home town, Kolkata, have been a lifelong inspiration for this designer who believes that "clothes should just be an extension of one's intellect".
        He uses unusual fabrics, texturing and detailing, fusion of styles, patch-work with embellishments in a vibrant colors. His creations evoke images of ancient and medieval ages. He describes his own collections as "an International styling
        with an Indian soul".
        He designs crafted bridal wear and rigorously structured pieces.[18] On occasion, to the delight of his global audiences, the designer is known to draw inspirations from the wider world, such as exotic, indigenous
        ethnic European art such as the colourscapes of French impressionists like Monet and Henry Matisse in his clothes.
        He pioneered the use of high-end luxury Indian textiles in a modern context. His unique contribution was the use of classical methods like bandhani, gota work, block printing, hand dyeing etc. in construction of modern silhouettes.
        Sabyasachi is especially famous for Indian Bridal Wear.[20]</td>
